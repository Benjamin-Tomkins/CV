#### <a name="About"></a>About :

Half-baked full stack entry level developer, and recent Makers Academy graduate â€” with a history of making, inventing, designing, and prototyping cool stuff you can touch; using tools like <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">`this`</a>, and <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/category/3d-cad">`this`</a>. And writing things like <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5a/83/c8/eb2fdf603fb63d/US20070288410A1.pdf">`this`</a>, and <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/41/67/07/4e40fcfb69e406/US7340060.pdf">`this`</a> ( its trendy now ðŸ¤·). And sometimes you'll find me on a ladder doing <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/plastering_1.jpg">`this`</a>, and turning things like <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/building_1.jpg">`this`</a>.. into <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/building_2.jpg">`this`</a>
