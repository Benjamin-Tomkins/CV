#### <a name="About"></a>About :

Half-baked full stack entry level developer, and recent Makers Academy graduate ‚Äî with a history of making, inventing, designing, and prototyping cool stuff you can touch; using tools like <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">`this`</a>, and <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/category/3d-cad">`this`</a>. And writing things like <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5a/83/c8/eb2fdf603fb63d/US20070288410A1.pdf">`this`</a>, and <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/41/67/07/4e40fcfb69e406/US7340060.pdf">`this`</a> (its trendy now ü§∑). And sometimes you'll find me on a ladder doing <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/plastering_1.jpg">`this`</a>, and turning things like <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/building_1.jpg">`this`</a>.. into <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Tomkins/CV/blob/master/images/building_2.jpg">`this`</a>



#### <a name="Projects"></a>Projects :

++ Property development and interior design [detail skills and examples]

++ Currently in development, self-aligning wound healing plasters to reduce caesarean section scars.

++ Developed a new concept/prototype for a tiered compiler, by re-representing the program using matrix algebra, we were able to further simplify (using the Maple interface) and further optimised by the language compiler. [meh]

++ Designed and developed an integrated database numerical engine to enable computation on medical data without violating patient confidentiality. [elaborate]

++ Lead architect and designer for a prototype Ai Cancer detection system for analysing voxel-based data for computed tomography scanners (CT). Worked by highlighting potential cancers, rather like a probabilistically shaded 3D spell checker to represent likelihood, and integrated recommender system to determine which radiologist subspecialties (ordered by likelihood) should be consulted - and in which order - to reduce unnecessary patient tests during diagnosis. [wording sucks]

++ Ai system for SLR lenses. Client wanted a solution to improve the quality of glass lenses to be closer to that of gemstone lenses (lower noise and greater colour range), but without the need to retool an entire factory. The solution I designed and prototyped involved a form of ‚Äúsynthetic imagination chip‚Äù, trained on millions of images, that was able to predict and redraw a glass lens image to be within 76% that of a gemstone lens image. [you‚Äôre welcome, world]

++ Number systems for efficiently identifying large primes *NDA* but can elaborate more

++ Cool plant/aeroponics stuff [elaborate]

++ Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence Patents:
